ldesc: "JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared 
libraries (DLLs on Windows) without writing anything but Java code-no 
JNI or native code is required. This functionality is comparable to 
Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's ctypes. Access is dynamic at 
runtime without code generation."
